dren, without any prejudice to them. Ι >do not imagine 1
shall lie under any censure for having turned to a more fa·
vourable sense, certain passages of this author, and perhaps
of some others likewise‚ with a view to render them proper
for youth. We meet in this philosopher, as well as in all the
Heathen writers, principles of morality‚ which ought not to
bev instilled into Christians without some correctives‚ to re-
duce them to that standard of truth which our religion has ,
taught us. If, therefore, any principles of the Heatlzens
should be found in this book, not agreeable to tlze doctrine of
the goafiel,we trust the piety and vigilance osche masters will
tdlce care to observe to their scholare in a few words, 'in what
particular those principles deviatesrom it.

There have been Heathens, who, no doubt, persuaded
that it was reason which gave man his distinguished excel·
’ lence and merit, who endeavoured to follow it on many occa-
sions, and practised in several moral virtues, But beside
their want of knowledge and love of the only true God, and ‘
stus Cnms‘r his Son, the only true foundation of solid vir-
tue; some of them, who passed for the most virtuous, lie
under the imputation of great vices. Therefore we are far
from proposing them here as perfect patterns. We report
. some of their great actions, and wise sayings‚ without diving
into the motives of either, or examining what inconsistencies
they have fallen into in other respectS.

It would not be improper likewise to let them into some
knowledge of the several authors they translate: telling
them, hythe bye, who they were; in what age they lived:
and what subjects they wrote upon, Sto. It is a great degree
of learning, which costs little time, and is sure to be attend-
ed with good advantage.

Ic is recommendet! to Teaclzers to set their pupils to
translate a certain portion of thie Book· once a week—abouc
ten or twelve linea, carefully written by them and exasnin‘ed
by their macher, would tend considerably to their improve-
ment.
