‘PREFACE.J

1 HAVE made use of all the ancient profane authors,
Greek as well as Latin, which I thought might contribute to ·
the execution of my design. l have sometimes even blended
them, as it were, together, upon the same fact or the same
maxim, to make the object Ι proposed to the reader the more
visible, and to avoid repetition. I have generally preferred,
as'I ought, ,the Latins to the Greeks; and have been exact
in my references to both, that those who would, might with
ease have recourse to the originals.

1f 1 have often abridged historical facts, and precepts ·
of morality, it was to retrench what appeared· less agree-
able to my plan, or to prevent ⁴my work from growing too
lar e. ,
g Ι have not engaged myself in reconciling historians with
one another, in relation to the truth of a fact, or its circum·
stances. 1 cite my authority ; that ought to be my warrant,
and it is enough for me. ⁷

1 scarce any where pass my judgment‚ or make re-
flections upon the passages 1 have produced in this work
from the ancients, leaving that care to the masters, who
will do it by word of mouth to more advantage than Ι

. could by writing.*

Seneca, the philosopher, abounds with maxims'and
examples, many of which 1 have thought proper to make

⁴ use of: and the rather, because this author is usually not

read in schoolS, and remains unknown to scholars the
rest of their lives. It is true, he betrays almost always
an affectation in his style; but his expression is short, and
his thoughts lively; and he embellishes his discourse with
natural comparisons and. images, which entertain the ima·
gination: so that with the alterations I have taken the li-
berty of making, in what I have horrowed from him, 1 f
hope he will be able to please‚ and be intelligible to chil-
