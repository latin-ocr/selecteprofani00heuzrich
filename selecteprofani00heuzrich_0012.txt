My Dear Friends,

The Editor of this Book, Seleetae e Profanis Scrip-
toribus Historiae, did not know,any way by which he
could better promote the cause os classical learning, than
by employing his ability and attention to an edition of it ς

well adopted, as he judges, to the accurate instruction 'of ’

. the youth in our country.

Surely it contains many excellent sentimentS, abound-

’ ing with the pithy‚ sublime ⁴sayings of the greatest an-

cientsphilosophers, both Greek and Romam· and there is
hardly any other book, better adopted for the profitable
- instruction os youth in the Latin tongue.

The student, who is learning· this book, cannot but lay
upa very considerable stock os sound morality ; whilst,
at the same time, he is acquiring the knowledge of Latin,
in a tract and course the most delightful and engaging.
It is well worthy of being wholly read .- and every man
of letters, who takes it up, and opens it, in any part, must
¹ be highly entertained with it.

Iam, very respectfully,
Your obedient and hearty friend,

JAMES Ross.
